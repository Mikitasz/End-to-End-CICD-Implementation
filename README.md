## Description
This project aims to establish a streamlined CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins for the development and deployment of a personal portfolio website. The live version of the website is accessible at http://profilelbs-253728117.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/.
The main repository is set to private due to the utilization of private keys for security purposes.

In this straightforward pipeline development initiative, Jenkins is configured to trigger automatically upon code changes in the GitHub repository.

The architecture diagram is as follows:
