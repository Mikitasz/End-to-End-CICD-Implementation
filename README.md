## Description
This project was created to create a simple CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins. The development object is the CV site itself. This site can be accessed at http://profilelbs-253728117.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/. Also the main repository is private as it uses private keys. In this simple pipeline development project, Jenkins is triggered every time the code enters the git hub.
